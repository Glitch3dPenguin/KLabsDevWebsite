```bash
echo "HELLO WORLD"
```

I am Max Kulik / Glitch3dPenguin. 
I am a full-time streamer and a tech hobbyist. Most of my time is spent making content that I love to share with the world. When I have spare time I work on personal projects like home automation, home lab building, quality of life scripts, and other digital projects. 

I entered the digital world when I was very young and always had obsessive fascination with the internet of things. I have worked with microcontrollers, bare metal servers, hypervisors, networking equipment, web servers, DNS providers, and a slew of programming languages.

To build these skills I have ran a few different versions of a home labs. My first server started as an old Celeron server with 4Gb of ram running Ubuntu server all the way to my current Xeon build that populated by a full suite of virtualized workloads.
